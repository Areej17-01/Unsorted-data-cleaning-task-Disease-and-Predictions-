# Unsorted-data-cleaning-task-Disease-and-Predictions-

This data (Disease-and-Predictions.csv) is way too dirty, as there is no proper detail and the data is scattered all over the columns. I've cleaned it to a certain level; I've separated columns for the similar data, and it can be further cleaned by seperating ages and drugs into separate columns.
